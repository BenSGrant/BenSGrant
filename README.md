### About [me](https://garytheblobfish.github.io):

  - I am a software and game developer with (some) experience in C++, Java and Python  
  - I like to program graphics with C++ and OpenGL  
  - For full games that I make with friends and on my own, I use Unity  

### Currently working on:
  - A private game engine
  - Games with an indie studio (ish) made up of me and a couple of friends (see [Joxnt](https://github.com/joxnt))
